            <p>If the competition is not full by the time the timer runs out, there will be added time in order for all tickets to be sold. If by then the competition still is not completely sold out a cash alternative will be awarded but we will hope this will never be the case.</p>

          <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>Yes once the competition is closed we will allow up to 48hrs before we go LIVE on Facebook. Each entrant who has answered the question correctly and picked a number will be put on a spreadsheet and this will be posted on our Facebook page for everyone to see. We then use Googleâ€™s random number generator to choose a winner. Nothing can influence the outcome of the draw.</p>

            <p>Emails are automatically sent out as soon as payment is confirmed and this email contains your entry number(s). If it did not appear in your Inbox, it is more than like in your Spam/Junk folder so keep an eye on this.</p>
